            <p>
                RecBlast web takes several parameters as input: <br><br>
                1.	<strong>Reference taxon:</strong> The reference taxon can be inserted as text (e.g. Homo sapiens) or as taxon number (e.g. 9606).<br><br>
            <code>Homo sapiens</code><br><br>
                2.	<strong>List of target taxa:</strong> the web server currently limits the amount of taxa to 10.
                Please enter full and specific taxon names and ids (e.g - Hydra will not work, Hydra vulgaris will).
                The taxa list can be inserted as a list of names, taxa ids, or a mix of both separated by a new line.
                The data can be inserted manually, or uploaded as a file (csv or txt).
                An example for a correct structure:<br><br>
                <code>9606<br>Hydra vulgaris<br>5202</code><br><br>
                3.	<strong>List of biological units of interests:</strong> the user can upload a file(csv or txt)/type
                names of genes (preferably as appear in their UniProt Entry Name), UniProt IDs,
                accession numbers, GIs or a a mix of the above separated by a new line.
                An example for a correct structure:<br><br>
                <code>ADCY1_MOUSE<br>Q08828<br>XP_011291944.1</code><br><br>
                4.	<strong>Run Name:</strong> a name given to the specific run.<br><br>
                5.	<strong>Email:</strong> User's email. Please notice that each user is permitted to send only one job at a time.<br><br>
                6.	<strong>BLAST parameters:</strong> E-Value (0-10), Coverage percentage (0-100) and Identity percentage (0-100).
                    <br>An optional backwards e-value can be supplied and used for the second BLAST back against the reference taxon.<br><br>
                7.	<strong>String Similarity:</strong> A number between 0 to 1 representing the similarity between two given proteins. <br>
                    A result is determined identical if its protein sequence is similar in more than 99% to the canonical
                    protein sequence of the inspected gene, or if the similarity of the annotation of both proteins is
                    than the 'string similarity' parameter defined by the user. We found 0.4 to give the best results.
