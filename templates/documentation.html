                RecBlast web takes several parameters as input: <br>
                1.	Reference taxon: The reference taxon can be inserted as text (e.g. Homo sapiens) or as taxon number (e.g. 9606).<br>
            <code>Homo Sapiens</code><br>
                2.	List of target taxa: the web server limits the amount of taxa to 10.
                The taxa list can be inserted as a list of names, taxa ids, or as a mix. The data can be inserted
                manually, or uploaded as a file. The structure of the file/text is:<br>
                <code>9606<br>Hydra Vulgaris<br>5202</code><br>
                3.	List of biological units of interests: the user can upload a file/type names of genes, Uniprot ids,
                accession numbers, gis or a mix of them:
                <code>ADCY1<br>Q08828<br>XP_011291944.1</code><br>
                It is possible to upload a file with a list of genes, and it's also possible to upload a csv file
                which contains the description of the genes and the desired uniprot IDs. This is the structure of the
                csv file:
                 <code>gene name<\t>gene description<\t>uniprot id
                 </code><br>
                4.	Run Name – a name given to the specific run.
                5.	BLAST parameters: E-Value (0-10), Coverage percentage  (0-100) and Identity percentage (0-100). An optional backwards e-value can be supplied and used for the second BLAST back against the reference taxon.
                6.	String Similarity – A number between 0 to 1 representing the similarity between two given genes. A result is determined "similar enough" if its protein sequence is similar in more than 99% to the canonical protein sequence of the inspected gene, or if the similarity of the annotation of both proteins is greater than the 'string similarity' parameter defined by the user.
