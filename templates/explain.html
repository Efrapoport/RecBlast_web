            <p>Once your results are ready, you will be notified via email and a link valid for 7 days will be generated for you.
               Using this link, you will be able to download a file (output.zip) with two types of files:
            <ul>
            <li> Three different CSV files - RBH, STRICT and NON-STRICT, each containing a matrix of the inspected gene and taxa.
                Per every gene-taxa combination, you will see the amount of matches that RecBlast found.
            </li>
            <li>
                FASTA sequences of all successful potential orthologues.
            </li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>What do the different strictness levels (RBH, STRICT and NON-STRICT) mean?</h2>
            <p>
                RecBlast works in three degrees of flexibility: RBH, STRICT and NON-STRICT mode.  RBHs are selected
                only when the first match (per species) from the first BLAST is successfully blasted back against the
                reference genome. When considering RBH, the program only cares about the highest scoring match it sees - the
                quantity of matches does not matter. For example, it doesn't matter if gene1 has 200 successful matches
                against Mus Musculus, but only 20 successful matches against Danio Rerio â€“ the only match that matters
                is the first match).

            <p>
                "Strict" matches do take into account the amount of successful matches. Not only the highest scoring first
                match is taken into account, but also all other matches that passed the quality threshold. Therefore, if
                gene1 has 200 successful matches against Mus Musculus, the maximum "strict" score possible is 200 (And not 1, like RBH):

            <p>
                "Non-Strict Matches" calculates successful matches slightly differently; this method is more flexible regarding the
                second BLAST: it's only important that the original gene (in the illustration: gene1) is present in the list of successful
                matches; it does not have to be the first, highest scoring match, it can be the second, third, fourth etc., as long as it
                passed the quality thresholds.
